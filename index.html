      <p>
        Hi! I'm Baurice Kovatchev, a junior studying electrical engineering and economics at Brown University. I love building anything that comes my way, and throughout my time in college I have gained practical experience building cars, circuits, and control systems. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy playing hockey, and I am on the club hockey team at Brown. I also play cello in a chamber music group. And I have completed 2 sprint triathlons! 
      </p>
